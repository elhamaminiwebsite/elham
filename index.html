       <h2>About me!</h2>
       <p>I am studying Master of Science in Information (MSI) at the University of Michigan, School of Information.<br>I am interested in Human Computer Interaction, UX/UI Design and Data Analytics. Currently, I am doing research under supervision of professor Eytan Adar. My active projects are SmartCues and Design Kit.</p>

       <h3>SmartCues: A Multitouch Query Approach for Details-on-Demand </h3>
       <p>Details-on-demand is a crucial feature in the visual information-seeking process but is often only implemented in highly constrained settings. The most common solution, hover queries (i.e., tooltips), are fast and expressive but are usually limited to single mark (e.g., a bar in a bar chart). 'Queries' to retrieve details for more complex sets of objects (e.g., comparisons between pairs of elements, averages across multiple items, trend lines, etc.) are difficult for end-users to invoke explicitly.<br> Further, the output of these queries requires complex annotations and overlays which need to be displayed and dismissed on demand to avoid clutter. In this work we introduce SmartCues, a library to support details-on-demand through dynamically computed overlays. For end-users, SmartCues provides multitouch interactions to construct complex queries for a variety of details. For designers, SmartCues offers an interaction library that can be used out-of-the-box and can be extended for new charts and detail types.<br> We demonstrate how SmartCues can be implemented across a wide array of visualization types and, through a lab study, show that end users can effectively use SmartCues.</p>
       <h3>DesignKit: A Toolkit for Design of Visual Analytic Systems</h3>
       <p>Visualization collaborations often take place between visualization designers and researchers in other areas known as domain experts. In order to have an effective collaboration, a mutual understanding between them is crucial. However, such communications mostly face significant challenges. The reason is that visualization designers and domain experts have different professional backgrounds and so there is a knowledge gap between them. Moreover, domain problems that are tackled in visualization research; such as, microbiology, physics or e-commerce, are inherently abstract. Often, it is not even easy for the domain expert to describe the problem, which further exacerbate the challenge of clear communication.<br>So far, various visualization models have been introduced to guide a successful design activity. In all of them, the problem characterization and abstraction are among the most important steps.<br> In this stage, which is iterative and cyclic, the expert speaks about the problem, and the visualization designer listens. The designer abstracts and then elicits feedback from the expert on the abstraction. This characterization of problem will contribute to the shared understanding of domain experts and visualization designers, and as a result, it leads to a successful design and effective solution. However, this process is time-consuming and inefficient.<br>In this project, we aim to introduce an interactive interface that enables designers to visualize the problem and generate probable data, while interviewing the domain expert. This can lead to a better communication between them and speeding up the design process.
